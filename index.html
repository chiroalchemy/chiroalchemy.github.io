    <p><i>Do you have headaches? A sore back or neck? Feel tired all the time?</i></p>
    <p><i>Are you stiff or ache all over? Have less than ideal/restricted movement?</i></p>
    <p><i>Or just don’t feel at your best?</i></p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 10px">Chiropractic care is a natural form of healthcare which aims to help you achieve optimal health, function and wellness through the use of gentle manual adjustments, soft tissue release, cranials and specific exercises to ensure your spine, posture and daily movements allow your body and nervous system to function at its best. Spinal health and movement is essential for your overall health and function.</p>
<p>We are two passionate Chiropractors, graduating from the New Zealand College of Chiropractic in 2012 with a Doctor of Chiropractic Science degree. Our goal is to not only get people out of pain, but to help them feel and function at their best, so they can achieve everyday health goals and take responsibility for their health.</p>
<p>Life is for living and for getting the most out of every day. Don’t let the limitations of your current state of health restrict you from living the life you want to live.</p>
<p>We look forward to helping you achieve your goals and to feel your best.</p>

<p>Siobhan & Terry</p>
